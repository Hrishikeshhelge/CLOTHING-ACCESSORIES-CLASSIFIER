# CLOTHING-ACCESSORIES-CLASSIFIER
#### This deep learning project walks through step by step process of how to build a Clothing & accessories Classifier model. We have build this model using keras from Tensorflow & Scraping data with the help of Keras.
### During model building we have covered almost all data science concepts such as:
1. Import Libraries
2. Load Data
3. Show Image from Numbers
4. Feature Scaling
5. Build First Neural Network
6. Train Model
7. Test & Evaluate Model
8. Confusion Matrix
9. Classification Report
10. Save Mode
### Technology and tools this project covers:
1. Python as a programming language.
2. keras from Tensorflow & sklearn librarys to create Deep Learning model.
3. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning.
4. Matplotlib & seaborn for data visualization.
5. Jupyter notebook as IDE.
* All the steps required to execute the project have been mentioned in the .ipynb file.
